 <h3>Nepal</h3>
 My name is Roshan Thapaliy and I am from Nepal.

  <h4>Geography</h4>
  A landlocked country the size of Arkansas, lying between India and the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China, Nepal contains Mount Everest (29,035 ft; 8,850 m), the tallest mountain in the world. Along its southern border, Nepal has a strip of level land that is partly forested, partly cultivated. North of that is the slope of the main section of the Himalayan range, including Everest and many other peaks higher than 8,000 m.

  <h4>Government</h4>
  In Nov. 1990, King Birendra promulgated a new constitution and introduced a multiparty parliamentary democracy in Nepal. Under pressure amid massive pro-democracy protests in April 2006, King Gyanendra gave up direct rule and reinstated Parliament, which then quickly moved to diminish the King's power. In Dec. 2007, Parliament voted to abolish the monarchy and become a federal democratic republic. The transition to a republic was completed in May 2008, when the Constituent Assemby voted to dissolve the monarchy.

  <h4>History</h4>
  The first civilizations in Nepal, which flourished around the 6th century B.C. , were confined to the fertile Kathmandu Valley where the present-day capital of the same name is located. It was in this region that Prince Siddhartha Gautama was born c. 563 B.C. Gautama achieved enlightenment as Buddha and spawned Buddhism.

  Nepali rulers' early patronage of Buddhism largely gave way to Hinduism, reflecting the increased influence of India, around the 12th century. Though the successive dynasties of the Gopalas, the Kiratis, and the Licchavis expanded their rule, it was not until the reign of the Malla kings from 1200â€“1769 that Nepal assumed the approximate dimensions of the modern state.

  The kingdom of Nepal was unified in 1768 by King Prithvi Narayan Shah, who had fled India following the Moghul conquests of the subcontinent. Under Shah and his successors, Nepal's borders expanded as far west as Kashmir and as far east as Sikkim (now part of India). A commercial treaty was signed with Britain in 1792 and again in 1816 after more than a year of hostilities with the British East India Company.

  <h4>The Independence of Nepal and the First Free Election</h4>
  In 1923, Britain recognized the absolute independence of Nepal. Between 1846 and 1951, the country was ruled by the Rana family, which always held the office of prime minister. In 1951, however, the king took over all power and proclaimed a constitutional monarchy. Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah became king in 1955. After Mahendra died of a heart attack in 1972, Prince Birendra, at 26, succeeded to the throne.

  In 1990, a pro-democracy movement forced King Birendra to lift the ban on political parties. The first free election in three decades provided a victory for the liberal Nepali Congress Party in 1991, although the Communists made a strong showing. A small but growing Maoist guerrilla movement, seeking to overthrow the constitutional monarchy and install a Communist government, began operating in the countryside in 1996.

  On June 1, 2001, King Birendra was shot and killed by his son, Crown Prince Dipendra. Angered by his family's disapproval of his choice of a bride, the crown prince also killed his mother and several other members of the royal family before shooting himself. Prince Gyanendra, the younger brother of King Birendra, was then crowned king.

 <h3>My biography</h3>
 <br>
 <img style="float:left; padding-right:20px;" src ="images/11.jpg" height='400' width='300'></td>
 <p>I am Roshan Thapaliya. I am Junior Computer Science major at Howard University. I am from Nepal. I came to US two years ago for my undergraduate studies. I knew very little programming back then. The first programming language I learnt at the Howard University was Python. I like Python very much because it is simple syntactically and thus you can focus on solving problems. I like to use python to solve problems on Project Euler which is an online collection of mathematical problems that can be solved through programming. Besides python, I have also done C, C++, Javascript and Java. I knew HTML and CSS from high school.</p>
 <p>
  Talking about my hobbies, I like to read novels, play and watch soccer, and travel. Last summer I was in California. I loved the places in California very much. San Franscisco is the prettiest city ever. I would say the same about New York, but only during summer. Likewise I love Washington DC during the fall season when the leaves on trees turn into different hues.

 <h3>My Projects</h3>
 <h4>Personal Web Site:</h4>
 I just completed making a personal website for Software Engineering class. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Google Polymer to construct the site. <br>
 <img src="images/personal_site.png" height='400' width='600'> 
 <h3> Shortest Path Algorithm: </h3>
 I wrote a breadth first search algorithm in python to find shortest links between two wikipedia links. 
 <pre>
  from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
  import urllib2
  import re

  _WIKIPEDIA = 'https://en.wikipedia.org'

  def get_wiki_page(link):
  store = []
  html_page = urllib2.urlopen(link)
  soup = BeautifulSoup(html_page)
  for link in soup.findAll('a'):
  if bool(link.get('title')):
  links = link.get('href')
  if bool(links):
  if bool(re.match('/wiki/',links)):
  store.append(links)
  return store

  def bfs_path(start , end):
  m = [[start]]
  while True:
  i = m.pop()
  print i
  for value in get_wiki_page(i[-1]):
  check_end = _WIKIPEDIA + value
  if check_end not in i:
  if check_end == end:
  return i + [check_end]
  m=([i+[check_end]]) + m
</pre>
<h3> Crowd Simulation</h3>
In my first summer I did a research on crowd simulation. I created an online simulation of a panicked crowd at a soccer match after a fire. I changed different factors and tested how that would affect the death rate in the simulation.
Here is the link to the project page.

 <h3>Famous Quotes. </h3>
 <i>
  To see a world in a grain of sand and heaven in a wild flower Hold infinity in the palms of your hand and eternity in an hour.
</i>
<br>
-William Blake
<br><br>
<i>
  I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.
</i>
<br>
-Henry David Thoreau, Walden
<br><br>
<i>
  No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.
</i>
<br>
-Steve Jobs
<br><br>
<i>
  Imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not, and therefore the fount of all invention and innovation. In its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity, it is the power to that enables us to empathize with humans whose experiences we have never shared.

</i>
<br>
-J.K. Rowling
